Identification and segmentation of organs and tissues in the presence of tumors are difficult. Automatic segmentation of the primary tumor mass in neuroblastoma could facilitate reproducible and objective analysis of the tumor's tissue composition, shape, and size. However, due to the heterogeneous tissue composition of the neuroblastic tumor, ranging from low-attenuation necrosis to high-attenuation calcification, segmentation of the tumor mass is a challenging problem. In this context, methods are described in this book for identification and segmentation of several abdominal and thoracic landmarks to assist in the segmentation of neuroblastic tumors in pediatric {CT} images. Methods to identify and segment automatically the peripheral artifacts and tissues, the rib structure, the vertebral column, the spinal canal, the diaphragm, and the pelvic surface are described. Techniques are also presented to evaluate quantitatively the results of segmentation of the vertebral column, the spinal canal, the diaphragm, and the pelvic girdle by comparing with the results of independent manual segmentation performed by a radiologist. The use of the landmarks and removal of several tissues and organs are shown to assist in limiting the scope of the tumor segmentation process to the abdomen, to lead to the reduction of the false-positive error, and to improve the result of segmentation of neuroblastic tumors., Title from {PDF} title page (viewed Apr., 16, 2009)., Includes bibliographical references (pages 127-138) and index.},

The problem of partitioning multidimensional biomedical data into meaningful regions is perhaps the main roadblock in the automation of biomedical image analysis. Whether the modality of choice is {MRI}, {PET}, ultrasound, {SPECT}, {CT}, or one of a myriad of microscopy platforms, image segmentation is a vital step in analyzing the constituent biological or medical targets. This book provides a state-of-the-art, comprehensive look at biomedical image segmentation that is accessible to well-equipped undergraduates, graduate students, and research professionals in the biology, biomedical, medical, and engineering fields. Active model methods that have emerged in the last few years are a focus of the book, including parametric active contour and active surface models, active shape models, and geometric active contours that adapt to the image topology. Additionally, Biomedical Image Analysis: Segmentation details attractive new methods that use graph theory in segmentation of biomedical imagery. Finally, the use of exciting new scale space tools in biomedical image analysis is reported., Title from {PDF} title page (viewed Mar. 16, 2009)., Includes bibliographical references (pages 101-106).},

	abstract = {Computed tomography ({CT}) has had a profound effect on the practice of medicine. Both the spectrum of clinical applications and the role that {CT} has played in enhancing the depth of our understanding of disease have been profound. Although almost 90 000 articles on {CT} have been published in peer-reviewed journals over the past 40 years, fewer than 5\% of these have been published in Radiology. Nevertheless, these almost 4000 articles have provided a basis for many important medical advances. By enabling a deepened understanding of anatomy, physiology, and pathology, {CT} has facilitated key advances in the detection and management of disease. This article celebrates this breadth of scientific discovery and development by examining the impact that {CT} has had on the diagnosis, characterization, and management of a sampling of major health challenges, including stroke, vascular diseases, cancer, trauma, acute abdominal pain, and diffuse lung diseases, as related to key technical advances in {CT} and manifested in Radiology.},

	abstract = {Computer-aided diagnosis ({CAD}), encompassing computer-aided detection and quantification, is an established and rapidly growing field of research. In daily practice, however, most: radiologists do not yet use {CAD} routinely. This article discusses how to move {CAD} from the laboratory to the clinic. The authors review the principles of {CAD} for lesion detection and for quantification and illustrate the state-of-the-art with various examples. The requirements that radiologists have for {CAD} are discussed: sufficient performance, no increase in reading time, seamless work-flow integration, regulatory approval, and cost efficiency. Performance is still the major bottleneck for many {CAD} systems. Novel ways of rising {CAD}, extending the traditional paradigm of displaying markers for a second look, may be the key to using the technology effectively. The most promising strategy to improve {CAD} is the creation of publicly, available databases for training and validation. This can identify the most: fruitful new research directions, and provide a platform to combine multiple approaches for a single task to create superior algorithms. (C) {RSNA}, 2011},

	abstract = {Because of its fast image acquisition and the rich diagnostic information it provides, computed tomography ({CT}) has gradually become a popular imaging modality among clinicians. Because {CT} scanners emit x-rays, the increased use of {CT} in clinical applications inevitably leads to increased medical radiation dose to the population. Because of the well-known cancer-inducing effects of high dose x-ray radiation, this increased dose has caused concerns among policy makers and general public that {CT} patients may be at a higher risk of developing cancer. Over the years, {CT} manufacturers have developed a variety of strategies to address this issue, the latest being a model-based iterative reconstruction ({MBIR}) algorithm. {MBIR} is an advanced {CT} algorithm that incorporates modeling of several key parameters that were omitted in earlier algorithms to reduce computational requirement and speed up scans. This review article examines the latest literature in the clinical {CT} field and discusses the general principles of {MBIR}, its dose and noise reduction potentials, its imaging characteristics, and its limitations. {MBIR} algorithm and its application in today's {CT} imaging will greatly reduce the radiation dose to patients and improve image quality for clinicians. En raison de la rapidité de l’acquisition de l’image et de la richesse de l’information diagnostique qu’elle offre, la tomographie par ordinateur a rapidement gagné en popularité chez les cliniciens. Puisque les appareils de tomographie émettent des rayons X, leur utilisation croissante dans les applications cliniques conduit inévitablement à une augmentation de la dose de radiation médicale dans la population. En raison des effets cancérigènes bien connus des doses élevées de rayons X, cette dose accrue a soulevé des craintes chez les décideurs et le grand public du fait que les patients soumis à la tomographie par ordinateur puissent présenter un risque plus élevé de souffrir d’ un cancer. Au fil des années, les fabricants d’appareils de tomographie par ordinateur ont élaboré différentes stratégies pour aborder cet enjeu, le plus récent étant un algorithme de reconstruction itérative basée sur un modèle (model-based iterative reconstruction - {MBIR}). Le {MBIR} est un algorithme avancé de tomographie par ordinateur qui intègre la modélisation de plusieurs paramètres clés omis dans les algorithmes précédents afin de diminuer les exigences de calcul et accélérer le balayage. Cet article recense les plus récents articles publiés dans le domaine de la tomographie clinique et aborde des principes généraux du {MBIR}, de son potentiel de réduction de la dose et du bruit, de ses caractéristiques d’image et de ses limites. L’algorithme {MBIR} et son application en imagerie tomographique permettra de diminuer fortement la dose de rayonnement pour les patients et d’améliorer la qualité des images pour les cliniciens.},

Although all available solutions share the common mechanism of artifact reduction and/or potential for radiation dose savings, chiefly due to image noise suppression, the magnitude of these effects depends on the specific {IR} algorithm. In the first section of this contribution, the technical bases of {IR} are briefly reviewed and the currently available algorithms released by the major {CT} manufacturers are described. In the second part, the current status of their clinical implementation is surveyed.

Schilham (1) Keywords: Iterative reconstruction; Computed tomography; Low dose; Filtered back-projection; Systematic review Abstract: Objectives To explain the technical principles of and differences between commercially available iterative reconstruction ({IR}) algorithms for computed tomography ({CT}) in non-mathematical terms for radiologists and clinicians. Methods Technical details of the different proprietary {IR} techniques were distilled from available scientific articles and manufacturers' white papers and were verified by the manufacturers. Clinical results were obtained from a literature search spanning January 2006 to January 2012, including only original research papers concerning {IR} for {CT}. Results {IR} for {CT} iteratively reduces noise and artefacts in either image space or raw data, or both. Reported dose reductions ranged from 23 \% to 76 \% compared to locally used default filtered back-projection ({FBP}) settings, with similar noise, artefacts, subjective, and objective image quality. Conclusion {IR} has the potential to allow reducing the radiation dose while preserving image quality. Disadvantages of {IR} include blotchy image appearance and longer computational time. Future studies need to address differences between {IR} algorithms for clinical low-dose {CT}. Key Points {aC}/ Iterative reconstruction technology for {CT} is presented in non-mathematical terms. {aC}/ {IR} reduces noise and artefacts compared to filtered back-projection. {aC}/ {IR} can improve image quality in routine-dose {CT} and lower the radiation dose. {aC}/ {IR}'s disadvantages include longer computation and blotchy appearance of some images.

	abstract = {Image registration is finding increased clinical use both in aiding diagnosis and guiding therapy. There are numerous algorithms for registration, which all involve maximizing a measure of similarity between a transformed floating image and a fixed reference image. The choice of the similarity measure depends, to some extent, on the application. Methods based on the use of the joint intensity histogram have become popular because of their flexibility and robustness. A distinction is made between rigid-body and non-rigid transformations. The latter are needed for inter-subject registration or intra-subject registration in cases where the region of the body of interest is not considered rigid. Non-rigid transformation is normally achieved using a global model of the deformation but can also be defined by a set of locally rigid transformations, each constrained to a small block in the image. There is scope for further research on the incorporation of appropriate constraints, especially for the application of non-rigid transformations to nuclear medicine studies. Most of the initial practical concerns regarding image registration have been overcome and there is increasing availability of commercial software. There are several approaches to the validation of registration software, with validation of non-rigid algorithms being particularly difficult. Studies have demonstrated the accuracy on the order of half a pixel for both intra- and inter-modality registration (typically 2 to 3 mm). Although hardware-based registration has now become possible by using dual-modality instruments, software-based registration will continue to play an important role in nuclear medicine. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Background:Common carotid artery ({CCA}) ultrasound with measurement of intima-media thickness ({IMT}) is a safe and noninvasive technique for assessing subclinical atherosclerosis and determining cardiovascular risks. Moreover, the pattern of wall thickening in the brachial artery ({BA}) is rather diffuse compared to the carotid artery and may be a more sensitive indicator of long-term systemic exposure to risk factors. Therefore noninvasive evaluation of mechanical parameters changes of both arteries has gained the attention of researchers.Objectives:The aim of this study was to compare different edge detection techniques with speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion ({SRAD}) de-noising filter in ultrasound images of both arteries.Patients and Methods:In a cross-sectional design, an examination was performed on ten men with mean age of 40 ± 5 years from September 2012 to March 2013 through random sampling. An ultrasonic examination of the left {CCA} and {BA} was performed. The program was designed in the {MATLAB} software to extract consecutive images in {JPEG} format from the {AVI}. Another program was designed in the {MATLAB} software to apply regions of interest ({ROI}) on the {IMT} of the posterior wall of common carotid and brachial arteries. Next, different edge detections and {SRAD} filter were applied to the {ROI}, separately. Finally, the program measured mean-squared error ({MSE}) and peak signal to noise ratio ({PSNR}).Results:The lowest values of {MSE} and highest values of {PSNR} were achieved by Canny edge detection with de-noising {SRAD} filter for {IMT} of left {CCA} and {BA} in 90 frames.Conclusions:Based on the result, by measuring the {MSE} and {PSNR}, this study showed Canny edge detection with {SRAD} filter is better than other edge detections in terms of speckle suppression and details preservation in {CCA} and {BA} ultrasound images.},

Segmentation of anatomical structures, from modalities like computed tomography ({CT}), magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) and ultrasound, is a key enabling technology for medical applications such as diagnostics, planning and guidance. More efficient implementations are necessary, as most segmentation methods are computationally expensive, and the amount of medical imaging data is growing. The increased programmability of graphic processing units ({GPUs}) in recent years have enabled their use in several areas. {GPUs} can solve large data parallel problems at a higher speed than the traditional {CPU}, while being more affordable and energy efficient than distributed systems. Furthermore, using a {GPU} enables concurrent visualization and interactive segmentation, where the user can help the algorithm to achieve a satisfactory result. This review investigates the use of {GPUs} to accelerate medical image segmentation methods. A set of criteria for efficient use of {GPUs} are defined and each segmentation method is rated accordingly. In addition, references to relevant {GPU} implementations and insight into {GPU} optimization are provided and discussed. The review concludes that most segmentation methods may benefit from {GPU} processing due to the methods’ data parallel structure and high thread count. However, factors such as synchronization, branch divergence and memory usage can limit the speedup.},
